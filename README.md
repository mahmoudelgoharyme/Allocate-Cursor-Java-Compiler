# Allocate cursor statement - Java compiler

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Allocate Cursor statement Compiler project.

## Project Overview

The Allocate Cursor statement Compiler is a compiler project that focuses on implementing a compiler for the "Allocate Cursor" statement in a specific programming language. The purpose of this compiler is to parse, analyze, and generate executable code for programs that include the Allocate Cursor statement.

The project aims to provide an efficient and reliable solution for handling the Allocate Cursor statement in the target programming language. It incorporates lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization techniques.

## Features

- Lexical analysis and tokenization of input source code
- Syntax parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- Semantic analysis and type checking for the Allocate Cursor statement
- Code generation for the allocated cursor
- Optimization techniques for enhanced performance
